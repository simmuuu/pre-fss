// Brahmi and his gang have been chased by a group of police officers and are now 
// trapped in a building with M×N rooms, arranged in a grid format. Each room is 
// connected to its adjacent rooms both horizontally and vertically, forming a 
// complex layout. Fortunately, some rooms in the building are designated as 
// "safe zones," providing a possible escape for Brahmi and his gang.

// The building's rooms are marked with the following values:
//     -1 : Danger Zone - an area that Brahmi and his gang cannot enter.
//     0 : Safe Zone - an area that provides a possible escape.
//     -2 : Occupied by a gang member.
    
// Your task is to help Brahmi and his gang reach the nearest safe zones by 
// calculating the minimum distance from each gang member's room to a safe zone, 
// avoiding danger zones. If a gang member is unable to reach any safe zone, 
// mark their room with -2.

// Input Format:
// -------------
// Line-1 -> two integers M and N, size of the grid of rooms.
// Next M Lines -> N space separated integers, from this set [-2,-1,0] only.

// Output Format:
// --------------
// Print an integer as result.


// Sample Input-1:
// ---------------
// 4 4
// -2 -1 0 -2
// -2 -2 -2 -1
// -2 -1 -2 -1
// 0 -1 -2 -2

// Sample Output-1:
// ----------------
// 3 -1 0 1
// 2 2 1 -1
// 1 -1 2 -1
// 0 -1 3 4

// NOTE: Please refer the hint.
