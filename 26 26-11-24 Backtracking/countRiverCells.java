// The Pandavas and Kauravas each rule different kingdoms separated by a river. 
// If the two kingdoms are connected, the land will form a square-shaped area. 
// The kingdoms are represented by cells marked with 1, and the river is 
// represented by cells marked with 0.

// The Pandavas and Kauravas have decided to build a bridge over the river to 
// improve connectivity between their kingdoms. To minimize the cost of construction, 
// they aim to reduce the length of the bridge. The bridge can only be built on 
// river cells that are connected in the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, 
// and right).

// Your task is to help the rulers minimize the number of river cells used for 
// building the bridge, and return the count of river cells occupied.

// Input Format:
// -------------
// Line-1: An integer N, size of the land.
// Next N lines: N space separated integers, either 0 or 1. 

// Output Format:
// --------------
// Print an integer result.


// Sample Input-1:
// ---------------
// 4
// 1 1 1 0
// 1 0 0 0
// 1 0 0 1
// 0 0 1 1

// Sample Output-1:
// ----------------
// 2


// Sample Input-2:
// ---------------
// 5
// 1 1 0 0 0
// 1 1 0 0 0
// 0 0 0 0 1
// 0 0 0 1 1
// 0 0 1 1 1

// Sample Output-2:
// ----------------
// 3
