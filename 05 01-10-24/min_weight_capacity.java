// A warehouse stores boxes of different weights that need to be transported to 
// different distribution centers across multiple cities. The boxes are stored in 
// the order in which they were manufactured, and they must be transported in 
// this specific order. Each day, a truck is sent to pick up a load of boxes from 
// the warehouse. However, the truck has a limited carrying capacity based on its 
// maximum weight limit.

// You are tasked with determining the minimum weight capacity of the truck that 
// will allow all the boxes to be shipped in the given number of days without 
// violating the order in which the boxes are loaded. Each day, the truck can load
// as many boxes as possible without exceeding its weight capacity.

// Input Format:
// -------------
// line-1: two space separated integers, N boxes, and number of days.
// line-2: N space separated integers, weights of boxes.

// Sample Input-1: 
// ---------------
// 5 2
// 7 2 5 10 8

// Sample Output-1:
// ----------------
// 18

// Explanation:
// -------------
// A truck capacity of 18 is the minimum to transport all the boxes 
// in 2 days as follows:

// 1st day: 7, 2, 5 (total weight: 14)
// 2nd day: 10, 8 (total weight: 18)
// With a capacity less than 18, it is impossible to ship all the boxes in 
// the given number of days without exceeding the truck's weight capacity.


// Sample Input-2: 
// ---------------
// 8 4
// 1 5 6 7 3 2 9 4

// Sample Output-2:
// ----------------
// 12

// Explanation:
// ------------
// A truck capacity of 12 is the minimum to transport all the boxes in 4 days as follows:

// 1st day: 1, 5, 6 (total weight: 12)
// 2nd day: 7, 3, 2 (total weight: 12)
// 3rd day: 9 (total weight: 9)
// 4th day: 4 (total weight: 4)
