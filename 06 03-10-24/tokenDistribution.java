// You are participating in a token distribution game with three decks of tokens, 
// each containing x, y, and z tokens, respectively. Your goal is to maximize your 
// number of passes by distributing tokens according to the following rules:

// In each move, you must pick two different non-empty decks, take 1 token from each, 
// and distribute them to a shared pot. For each move, you earn 1 pass.
// The game ends when there are fewer than two non-empty decks 
// (i.e., no more moves can be made).

// Your objective is to find the maximum number of passes you can achieve by optimally
// distributing tokens. Given three integers x, y, and z representing the sizes of 
// the three decks, return the maximum possible passes you can earn.

// Input Format:
// -------------
// Three space separated integers, X,Y, Z.

// Output Format:
// --------------
// Print an integer, maximum possible passes you can earn.


// Sample Input-1:
// ---------------
// 3 5 7

// Sample Output-1:
// ----------------
// 7

// Explanation:
// ------------
// The game begins with (3, 5, 7). One optimal set of moves is:
// Take from the 1st and 3rd decks, state becomes (2, 5, 6)
// Take from the 1st and 3rd decks, state becomes (1, 5, 5)
// Take from the 1st and 3rd decks, state becomes (0, 5, 4)
// Take from the 2nd and 3rd decks, state becomes (0, 4, 3)
// Take from the 2nd and 3rd decks, state becomes (0, 3, 2)
// Take from the 2nd and 3rd decks, state becomes (0, 2, 1)
// Take from the 2nd and 3rd decks, state becomes (0, 1, 0)

// At this point, there are fewer than two non-empty decks, and 
// the game ends with a total of 7 passes.


// Sample Input-2:
// ---------------
// 4 4 5

// Sample Output-2:
// ----------------
// 6

// Explanation:
// ------------
// One optimal set of moves:
// Take from the 1st and 2nd decks, state becomes (3, 3, 5)
// Take from the 1st and 3rd decks, state becomes (2, 3, 4)
// Take from the 1st and 3rd decks, state becomes (1, 3, 3)
// Take from the 1st and 3rd decks, state becomes (0, 3, 2)
// Take from the 2nd and 3rd decks, state becomes (0, 2, 1)
// Take from the 2nd and 3rd decks, state becomes (0, 1, 0)

// The game ends with a total of 6 passes.
