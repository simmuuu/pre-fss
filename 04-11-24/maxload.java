// You are a warehouse manager responsible for distributing packages across different 
// storage bins to minimize the maximum load in any single bin. You are given an 
// integer array packages[] where the ith element represents the number of items in 
// the ith package. Additionally, you are given an integer maxSplits, which defines
// the maximum number of times you are allowed to split a package.

// A single split operation allows you to divide a package into two smaller packages, 
// each containing a positive number of items. For example, a package with 10 items 
// can be split into two new packages with sizes 6 and 4, or 3 and 7.

// Your objective is to minimize the "MaxLoad", defined as the maximum number of 
// items in any package, after performing at most maxSplits operations.


// Input Format:
// -------------
// Line-1: Two space separated integers, N and P
// Line-2: N space separated integers, packages[].

// Output Format:
// --------------
// Print an integer result, MaxLoad.


// Sample Input-1:
// ---------------
// 1 3
// 15

// Sample Output-1:
// ----------------
// 4

// Explanation:
// ------------
// Split the package with 15 items into packages of sizes 7 and 8. 
//     [15] -> [7,8].
// Split the package with 8 items into packages of sizes 4 and 4. 
//     [7,8] -> [7,4,4].
// Split the package with 7 items into packages of sizes 4 and 3. 
//     [7,4,4] -> [4,4,4,3].
// After these operations, the package with the highest load has 4 items, 
//     so the MaxLoad is 4.


// Sample Input-2:
// ---------------
// 3 4
// 6 15 24

// Sample Output-2:
// ----------------
// 3

// Explanation:
// ------------
// Split the package with 24 items into packages of sizes 8 and 16. 
//     [6,15,24] -> [6,15,8,16].
// Split the package with 16 items into packages of sizes 8 and 8. 
//     [6,15,8,16] -> [6,15,8,8,8]
// Split one of the packages with 15 items into packages of sizes 7 and 8. 
//     [6,15,8,8,8] -> [6,7,8,8,8,8]
// Split the remaining package with 8 items into packages of sizes 4 and 4. 
//     [6,7,8,8,8,8] -> [6,7,4,4,8,8,8]
// After these operations, the package with the highest load has 8 items, 
//     So the MaxLoad is 8.
