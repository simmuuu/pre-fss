// And issue only one ticket per head. 

// People are standing in a queue to buy from Quad Cinema counter, 
// and order one at a time. And they are paying with either a $25, $50, or $100 notes.

// You will be given, an array of notes[], the people are carrying with them.
// Your task is to issue ticket and settle the balance to each person, 
// If a person given a $50 note, Issue the ticket worth $25 and settle the balance $25.

// Print true, if and only if you can provide tickets and settle the balance 
// for all the people in the queue. Otherwise, false.

// Note: Initially you don't have any amount in hand.

// Input Format:

// Line-1: An integer N, number of persons
// Line-2: N space separated integers, notes with the persons.

// Output Format:
// --------------
// Print a boolean value.


// Sample Input-1:
// ---------------
// 5
// 25 25 25 50 100

// Sample Output-1:
// ----------------
// true

// Explanation:
// -----------
// - The first three people pay with $25, so no change is needed.
// - The fourth person pays with $50, and you return $25 as change.
// - The fifth person pays with $100, and you return $75 as change ($50 + $25).
// - Since every person gets their ticket and correct change, the answer is true.

// Sample Input-2:
// ---------------
// 5
// 25 25 50 50 100

// Sample Output-2:
// ----------------
// false

// Explanation:

// - The third and fourth people pay with $50, and you return $25 as change.
// - The fifth person pays with $100, but you cannot return $75 as change 
// (you only have $50 bills).
// Since not everyone can receive their correct change, the answer is false.
